"""`Earley`

`Earley` contains a recognizer and parser for context-free grammars.

Context-free grammars are modeled using the `CFG` datatype (preferred for
the recognizer) or the `Grammar` datatype (preferred for the parser). The
`Grammar` type includes a semantic action for each production rule of the
grammar.

The module provides the following functionality:

* `recognize(grammar, input)` checks if the `input` matches the language
  described by the `grammar`.

* `parse(grammar :: Grammar, input)` parses the `input` and computes the
  semantic actions on the parse tree.

* `parse(grammar :: CFG, input)` parses the `input` and returns a `ParseTree`.

* `matches(class, token)` is used by the algorithm to match a token (in the
  input) against a terminal/token class (in the right-hand side of a
  production rule). Some terminals are predefined in the `Match` submodule.

`recognize` supports all context-free grammars.

`parse` supports most practical grammars, including those with left-recursion,
right-recursion, mixed recursion, and ambiguity. However, cyclic grammars are
not supported as these may generate an infinite parse tree for a finite input.

### CFG datatype

"""`CFG{T}(rules[, start_symbol])`

A context-free grammar with terminals of type `T` (usually `Any`). If no
`start_symbol` is given, the lhs of the first rule in `rules` is assumed.

`rules` is an array of production rules in the form of tuples `(A => rhs)`,
where `A` is a nonterminal (a `Symbol`) and `rhs` is an array of terminals (of
any type) and nonterminals.

Examples
========

```
CFG{Char}([
  :A => ['a'],
  :A => [:A, :A]
]);
```
is an ambiguous grammar that matches any (nonzero) number of 'a' characters.

```
CFG{String}([
  :Block => ["{}"],
  :Block => ["if()", :Block],
  :Block => ["if()", :Block, "else", :Block],
]);
```
is a grammar that matches a trivial C-like language with "dangling else"
ambiguity. Unlike the previous example, input tokens are strings rather than
Chars.

```
CFG([
  :Number => [Match.Digit()],
  :Number => [Match.Digit(), :Number]
]);
```
matches an unsigned decimal number. The paramater `T` is assumed to be
`Any`.

# Assume tokens to be of type Any unless requested otherwise.
CFG(rules) = CFG{Any}(rules, first(rules)[1])
CFG(rules, start_symbol) = CFG{Any}(rules, start_symbol)



### Grammar datatype

"""`Grammar{T}(rules_and_actions[; start_symbol])`

A context-free grammar with terminals of type `T` (usually `Any`), as well as
a list of semantic actions (i.e. functions). `start_symbol` is an optional
argument specifying the start symbol (that needs to match the whole input). If
no value is supplied, the left-hand side of the first production rule is
assumed.

The list of rules and actions should be an iterable of tuples
`(lhs => rhs, action)`, where `lhs => rhs` is a production rule of a context
free grammar as described in the documentation for `CFG`. In short, `lhs`
should be a `Symbol` (nonterminal) and `rhs` should be an array of `Symbol`s
and terminals (which may be compared to the input using `matches`). The
`action` should be a function taking one argument for each terms on the
`rhs` of the rule and returning a single value.

In formal terms, `Grammar` describes an attribute grammar with synthesized
attributes, and the semantic actions are closures which define the attributes.

Example
=======

```
julia> g_num = Grammar([
  (:Number   => [:Unsigned],                 n      -> n),
  (:Number   => ['+', :Unsigned],            (_, n) -> n),
  (:Number   => ['-', :Unsigned],            (_, n) -> -n),
  (:Unsigned => [Match.Digit()],             d      -> (d - '0')),
  (:Unsigned => [:Unsigned, Match.Digit()],  (n, d) -> 10n + (d - '0'))
]);

### Earley Item datatype

"""`Item(start, rule, dot)`

Earley parser item, i.e. a compact representation of a partial parse.

* `start` is the position in the token stream where the partial parse begins,
  i.e. `start` is one if the parse starts at the first input token, two if it
  starts at the second input token, etc.
* `rule` is the index of the rule being parsed in the list of rules, i.e. one
  for the first rule, two for the second rule, etc.
* `dot` is the position of the 'dot' (in the common abstract notation of the
  algorithm), i.e. which sub-parse we're expecting next. The value is one if
  we need to try the first sub-parse, two if we need to try the second
  sub-parse, and equal to one plus the number of terms on the right-hand side
  if the sub-parse has been completed successfully.
"""
struct Item
  start :: Int
  rule :: Int
  dot :: Int
end


### recognizer

"""`recognize(grammar::CFG, input)`

Returns true if the input matches the given `grammar`, false otherwise. The
`input` shall be an array of tokens (e.g. Char, UInt8, String, â€¦).

Terminal input tokens are matched against token classes using `match`. The
default implemantation compares equality (i.e. if a token is present in the
right hand side of a production rule, that token must be matched in the input
for the rule to match), but `match` can be overloaded to create custom token
classes for convenience. For predefined classes, see `Earley.Match`.

There is no restriction on the `grammar`, except that it must be context-free.

Examples
--------

```
julia> recognize(
  CFG([
    :Par => ['(', :Par, ')'],
    :Par => []
    ]),
  "(()))"

false

Data structure representing a parse tree, or a node therein. The following

- `rule`: Index of the rule corresponding to this node in the tree. Values 1
  through `length(rules)` are used for actual rules, `0` is used for
  matched terminals.
- `start`: Start index of the subset of the input represented by this node.
- `stop`: One plus the last index of the subset of the input represented by
  this node. If `stop` == `start`, the node matches an empty subset. If
  `rule == 0` (i.e. the node corresponds to a terminal), `stop = start+1`,

implicitely stores the _last_ token consumed and returns a list of lists of
Earley items where every item corresponds to a _completed_ partial parse and

"""`parse(grammar::Grammar, input)`

Parse the given `input` according to the production rules and semantic actions
in `Grammar`, returning the result of the semantic action corresponding to the
rule that matches the whole input.

If the `grammar` is ambiguous, the parser will always use the first matching
rule to resolve the ambiguity.

Cyclic grammars are not supported as these can produce an infinite parse tree
for a finite input. Ambiguity, left-recursion and/or right-recursion do not
generally problem for the parser. All unambiguous context-free grammars are
supported.
